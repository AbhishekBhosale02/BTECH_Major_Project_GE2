An app-based audiometer designed to make hearing assessments more accessible, efficient, and mobile. This project allows users to perform pure-tone audiometry tests through a smartphone interface, offering an alternative to traditional audiometric equipment.

## 📌 Features

- 🎵 Pure-tone audiometry for different frequencies
- 📊 Graphical representation of hearing threshold (Audiogram)
- 🧠 User-friendly and intuitive UI
- 🧪 Calibration and testing protocols
- 📁 Result saving & export functionality
- 🔊 Volume control and standardization
- 📱 Works on mobile devices (Android/iOS)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Firebase
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - Audio playback 
  - Charting 

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User selects test ear and frequency range.
2. App plays tones at varying volumes.
3. User responds when tone is heard.
4. Hearing threshold is recorded.
5. Results are plotted as an audiogram.

## 🚀 Getting Started
